Had a really relaxing weekend. Tomorrow, it's time to get back to business.

Tomorrow's weight training session will hit lower back and abs. Here it is:

1. **Deadlifts | Push-through Sit-Ups**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 185 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body
2. **Lower Back Extension | Reverse Crunches**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 25 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body

With limited exercises for both, I'm increasing the number of sets here to compensate. Looking forward to executing on the strategy tomorrow.

Cheers!
