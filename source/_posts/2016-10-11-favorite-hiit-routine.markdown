Here is my favorite HIIT routine, and it is the one that I did this morning.

1. Push-up Burpee, then immediately go into
2. 3 mountain climbers (left right, left right, left right), then immediately go into
3. 3 jumping lunges

Repeat this cycle for 45 seconds straight, then take 15 seconds of rest.

Do 10 sets. Total duration of entire work out should be 10 minutes max.

Push yourself!
