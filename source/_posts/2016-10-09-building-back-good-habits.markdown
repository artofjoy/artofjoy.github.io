If I'm looking to get back into my peak conditions from 5 years ago, I'm going to have to start building back many good habits. I'll start with this:

**Eat a protein-filled meal every 2.5 to 3 hours**

I seem to let this one slip a lot. Whether it's not eating on time, or just not eating protein in a meal, I always seem to let this habit slip. I have a well-planned meal plan for every day of the week. Now, it's all about following that plan diligently (allowing just a couple of weekly cheat meals into the plan to account for my current lifestyle).

For each meal that I successfully conquer and finish eating, I'll mark it off on my personal habits app. Visually, I'm aiming for a sea of green marks on the app.

So, it's time to get those green marks for the rest of the day.
