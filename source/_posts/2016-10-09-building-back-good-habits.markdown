If I'm looking to get back into my peak conditions from 5 years ago, I'm going to have to start building back those good habits. I'll start with this:

- Eat a protein-filled meal every 2.5 to 3 hours

I seem to let this one slip. Whether or not I'm eating on time, or I'm not eating protein in that meal, I always seem to let this habit slip. I have a well-planned meal plan for every day of the week. Now, it's all about following that plan diligently (allowing just a couple of cheat meals in to adjust for my current lifestyle).

For each meal that I successfully conquer and finish eating, I'll mark it off on my personal habits app. Visually, I'm aiming for a sea of green squares on my app.

Time to get those green squares for the rest of the day.
