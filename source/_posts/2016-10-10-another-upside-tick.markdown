Just completed the first of my updated routines today. This is the arm workout posted last night. As always, with the first session ever, and given that this routine includes supersets, it's always prudent to go with lighter weights to achieve more volume and to get a feel for the rhythm.

I've recorded the weight that would make most sense for me to execute the next time the session comes back around. Here they are:

1. **Barbell Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 70lbs, 45 seconds rest
2. **Preacher Curl | Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 60lbs, 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 45 seconds rest
3. **Inclined Supinated DB Curl | Inclined Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 15lbs, 3 x 10 x 15lbs, 45 seconds rest
4. **Dips (Bodyweight)**
    - 3 x 10, 45 seconds rest
5. **Rope Pushdown**
    - 3 x 10 x 40lbs, 45 seconds rest
6. **Straight Bar Pushdown (Pronated) | Straight Bar Pushdown (Supinated)**
    - 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 45 seconds rest

For the rest of the day, it's all about the meal plan. I'll need to prepare 2 meals on the go today.

Time to go get more green marks.
