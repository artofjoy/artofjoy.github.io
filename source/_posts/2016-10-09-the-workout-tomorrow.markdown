I've updated my workout routine to a more focused style, targeting just a couple of muscle groups per session. This means more workout days per week, but it'll also allow me to focus intensely on just those few muscle groups.

Tomorrow I'm starting with **arms** because it's the muscle group that I haven't targeted in the longest, based on my current workout routine. Here's the new routine:

1. **Barbell Curl**
    - 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - use a full-length barbell for this, not the easy bars, to increase pressure on the biceps
2. **Preacher Curl | Neutral DB Curl**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - start standing on the correct side of the preacher curl machine, then graduate to the other side for more isolated focus
3. **Inclined Supinated DB Curl | Inclined Neutral DB Curl**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
4. **Dips (Bodyweight)**
    - 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - don't go lower than 90 deg
    - squeeze triceps
5. **Rope Pushdown**
    - 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - make sure to split the rope and hold
6. **Straight Bar Pushdown (Sup) | Straight Bar Pushdown (Pro)**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - switch between the supinated and pronated grips
    - squeeze triceps

We're going arms only here, biceps and triceps. Focusing on the muscle areas really closely to each other should optimize blood flow and oxygen delivery.
