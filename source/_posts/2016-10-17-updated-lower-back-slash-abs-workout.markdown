Here's the updated lower back/abs workout performed today:

Tomorrow's weight training session will hit lower back and abs. Here it is:

1. **Deadlifts | Push-through Sit-Ups**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 185 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body
2. **Lower Back Extension | Reverse Crunches**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 25 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body

Notes: I was able to do all exercises without rest-pause. For the next routine, I'd like to perform 5 sets of (12 10 8 8 8).

As for tomorrow, I'm back to cycling the weight lifting routine, going back to the arms. That looks like this:

1. **Barbell Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 70lbs, 45 seconds rest
2. **Preacher Curl | Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 60lbs, 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 45 seconds rest
3. **Inclined Supinated DB Curl | Inclined Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 15lbs, 3 x 10 x 15lbs, 45 seconds rest
4. **Dips (Bodyweight)**
    - 3 x 10, 45 seconds rest
5. **Rope Pushdown**
    - 3 x 10 x 40lbs, 45 seconds rest
6. **Straight Bar Pushdown (Pronated) | Straight Bar Pushdown (Supinated)**
    - 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 3 x 10 x 20lbs, 45 seconds rest

I can feel the momentum picking up. This is starting to get really fun. Can't wait to finish up the week strong!

Train hard.
