As I mentioned in yesterday's blog post about making new routines, I've also created a new shoulders and traps routine.

Here it goes:

1. **Seated Military Shoulder Press | Rear Deltoid DB Lateral**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - check ego here, seriously, go light weight
    - rear deltoid DB lateral should
2. **Arnold Shoulder Press | Plate Front Raises**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
3. **Face Pull | Shoulder Shrug**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - face pull should start neck level height, end in a double bicep pose (external rotation)
    - shoulder shrug can be done with plates or dumbbells
4. **Alternating Cable Lateral Raise | Alternating Dumbbell Front Raise**
    - superset, 3x10, 45 seconds rest
    - cable lateral raise done one set per side at a time, while front raises alternate rep by rep throughout the set

  This work out will need to be updated with the recommended weight after tomorrow's session. Note that they are **all** supersets.

  As for the habits so far, I've been eating the planned meals, so all habits related to proper nutrition have been marked green. Proper rest is next, so it's time to grab that green mark for sleep.
