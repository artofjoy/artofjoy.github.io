The gym was open today!

I've updated the shoulders and traps workout to include the suggested weight I'm comfortable with:

1. **Seated Military Shoulder Press | Rear Deltoid DB Lateral**
    - Seated Military Shoulder Press, 3 x 10 x 115
    - Rear Deltoid DB Lateral, 3 x 10 x 10
2. **Arnold Shoulder Press | Plate Front Raises**
    - Seated Military Shoulder, 3 x 10 x 50
    - Plate Front, 3 x 10 x 35
3. **Face Pull | Shoulder Shrug**
    - Face Pull, 3 x 10 x 7.5
    - Shoulder Shrug, 3 x 10 x 45
4. **Alternating Cable Lateral Raise | Alternating Dumbbell Front Raise**
    - Alternating Cable Lateral Raise, 3 x 10 x 7.5
    - Alternating Dumbbell Front Raise, 3 x 10 x 10

The goal for the next session here is to achieve those 10 reps without the rest-pause technique. Once that's achieved, it'll be time to apply progressive overload, along with rest-pause as needed.

Here's tomorrow's workout plan for legs:

1. **Leg Press**
    - 4 sets x 12 10 8 8
2. **Smith Machine Lunge**
    - 4 sets x 12 10 8 8
3. **Leg Extension**
    - 4 sets x 12 10 8 8
4. **Lying Leg Curl**
    - 4 sets x 12 10 8 8
5. **Seated Calf Raise**
    - 4 sets x 12 10 8 8
