Here's the updated workout plan for legs, with suggested weights:

1. **Leg Press**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 520
2. **Smith Machine Lunge**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 65
3. **Leg Extension**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 115
4. **Lying Leg Curl**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 80
5. **Seated Calf Raise**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 50

Holy smokes, waking up early at 4:30 in the morning to do these leg workouts? Not easy. I remember lying in bed wanting to skip today. Just 5 more minutes (which turns into 15 minutes, then 2 hours - we all know how it goes). But where's the self-discipline in that? Self-discipline means doing what you **should** do rather than what you **want** to do. In trying to achieve the build of, well, a bodybuilder, I need to work for it. Inconsistent behaviors do not build the habits required push the envelope. So hell yes, I conquered what would've been a negative habit. Progress.

Just that action alone made me realize the slight progress I had made, and when I got to the gym I was surprised that I had actually made it there. From that point, it motivated me to press the advantage as I conquered difficulties one by one - rep by rep, set by set, and then exercise by exercise. That's the power of momentum driven by self-discipline, made easier in the long-run by habits. That's a big win.

Meals were prepped today for the time outside of home. Can't wait to get back and consume those last two meals, then treat my body to a good night's rest.

Cheers everyone!
