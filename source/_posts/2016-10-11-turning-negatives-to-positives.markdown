This morning was a perfect example of maintaining that positive mindset throughout this journey. Here's what happened:

I completed my usual pre-workout routine and drove to the gym for that shoulders and traps workout that I had outlined [yesterday](/blog/2016/10/10/tomorrows-new-shoulder-routine/ "Tomorrow's New Shoulder Routine"). By the time I arrived at the doors, I saw a group of people standing outside waiting to go in and lift. The owner of the gym must've overslept, but I decided to wait it out for about 30 minutes. Nothing. It was pretty clear I would not be able to get my lifting session in before work.

At this point, it seemed like the only possible choice here was to skip working out for today and blame the owner for not doing their job. For not waking up and opening the doors for the 20 of us standing outside who actually woke up early to execute on our routine.

But I decided to look on the brighter side. Part of getting a massive, but shredded body, is including HIIT at least twice a week but no more than four times a week. I knew I wasn't going to have time after work to do lift or do any cardio, so what did I do? I drove home and cranked out 10 minutes of HIIT when I got back.

And it felt good. It felt good to sweat. It felt good to burn. And it felt good not just physically, but mentally. Not just from working out, but from overcoming that mindset of giving up. Giving up just because the gym wasn't open. Giving up by making excuses out of laziness. No, out with that negative thoughts, in with the positives. I didn't wake up early for nothing. I woke up to get shit done, and I'm going to do exactly that. No excuses.

This piece of information should be carried forward every day. Face every day with that positive attitude, just like I did today. Time get going with my plan and do everything to the utmost of my abilities.
