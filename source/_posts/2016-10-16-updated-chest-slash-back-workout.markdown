Here's my update for the chest and upper back workout performed last Friday

1. **Dumbbell Chest Press | Lat Pulldown**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 70 | 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 120
2. **Inclined Dumbbell Chest Press | Barbell Rows**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 60 | 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 95
3. **Cable Flies | Seated Rows**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 20 | 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 42.5

I actually performed 4 sets to stay consistent with the supersets I have in my other routines. In the last couple of sets for both the chest press exercises, I performed the rest-pause method to achieve the total number of reps. I will continue to do so until I can execute all reps without rest-pause before increasing the weight.

Cheers!
