Here's my back workout for tomorrow to hit the chest and upper back

1. **Dumbbell Chest Press | Lat Pulldown**
    - 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 70 | 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 120
2. **Inclined Dumbbell Chest Press | Barbell Rows**
    - 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 60 | 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 115
3. **Cable Flies | Seated Rows**
    - 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 15 | 3 sets x (10 8 8) x 60

The weights are suggested, so tomorrow they will be updated to represent what I actually performed.

Here's to another day of an intense superset workout!

Cheers!
