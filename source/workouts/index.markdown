Here's the current list of routines, updated over time:

Arms
=====
1. **Barbell Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 70lbs
2. **Preacher Curl | Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 60lbs, 3 x 10 x 20lbs
3. **Inclined Supinated DB Curl | Inclined Neutral DB Curl**
    - 3 x 10 x 15lbs, 3 x 10 x 15lbs
4. **Dips (Bodyweight)**
    - 3 x 10
5. **Rope Pushdown**
    - 3 x 10 x 40lbs
6. **Straight Bar Pushdown (Pronated) | Straight Bar Pushdown (Supinated)**
    - 3 x 10 x 25lbs, 3 x 10 x 25lbs

Notes:

For the barbell curl, only the last 4 reps of the last set did I need to employ rest-pause.
For the preacher curl | neutral DB curl superset, halfway through all of the sets, I had to rest pause
Finally, for the inclined dumbbell curl supersets, no rest pause.

For Dips, I moved the weight up to bodyweight + 25lbs. I like this weight, as I was able to do 10 of these on the first set, then 5 on the second, and 5 on the last. This is a good weight to be at for next time.
For the rope pushdowns, I had rest pause on the second and last set near the end
For the straight bar pushdowns, we can move the weight up on this to 30lbs.

Chest & Upper Back
=====
1. **Dumbbell Chest Press | Lat Pulldown**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 70 | 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 120
2. **Inclined Dumbbell Chest Press | Barbell Rows**

3. **Cable Flies | Seated Rows**
    - 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 20 | 4 sets x (12 10 8 8) x 85

Notes:

The last sets of each exercise required rest-pause technique, except for the **Cable Flies | Seated Rows**. Compared to last time, I definitely was able to do less rest-pause, which means the muscles are growing. I'll continue doing what works!

Lower Back & Abs
=====
1. **Deadlifts | Push-through Sit-Ups**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 185 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body
2. **Lower Back Extension | Reverse Crunches**
    - 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x 25 | 5 sets x (12 10 8 8 6) x body

Notes:

I was able to complete all sets with minimal rest-pause. The last rep in all of the lower-back extension sets required a rest-pause. Next time I want to up the weight on the deadlifts.
