It has been 5 years since the peak of my bodybuilding career, if you can even call it that now.

Since then, life has drastically changed. I don't live in the dorms by myself anymore. I work full time with a busy schedule at work. In essence, I've lost many of the necessary habits that I used to have to achieve a massive, but shredded look.

What happened? Well, I'd like to blame life, but really, it was a lack of discipline and not holding myself accountable. I let the bad habits into my life and allowed the good ones to slip.

I'm hoping that my updating this blog on a daily basis will help me hold myself accountable and help me push myself to train smarter and harder.
